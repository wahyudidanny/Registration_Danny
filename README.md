**Development using ASP.NET Framework 4 and using c# languages**
There's no database in this project, only using inmemory caching

## Reference
In this project, i'm only using 1 internal reference from Visual Studio (System.Runtime.Caching).Theres no any reference from outside Visual Studio 2015, you only need to import the internal reference

    1.Right click on the reference in the project
    2.Browse system.runtime.caching
    3.Check the box 
    4.Click OK

## CSS Style
I'm also using internal CSS for styling

If you want to check the project, modify or adding some feature in the program, feel free to make change,clone, or download the repository
